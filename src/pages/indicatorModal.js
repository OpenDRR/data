        <h1>Human Settlement and Natural Hazards in Canada</h1>
        <p>
          The National Human Settlement Layer (NHSL) is a collection of thematic
          datasets that describe the physical, social and economic
          characteristics of urban centres and rural/remote communities across
          Canada, and their vulnerability to natural hazards of concern.
          Detailed information on land use, buildings, people and capital assets
          are provided at the Census Dissemination Area administrative level for
          more than 454,000 settled areas across Canada. The Physical Exposure
          Layer includes a delineation of human settlement areas and related
          functional land use classes across Canada, and provides detailed
          information on construction type, occupancy and design level of more
          than 9.1 million buildings; population dynamics at different times of
          day for 35.1 million people, and; capital asset valuation of buildings
          and contents totaling more than 8.3 trillion CAD$. The Natural Hazard
          Threat Layer utilizes available national-level information on
          earthquake, flood, debris flow, wildfire, and severe wind hazards to
          evaluate the extent to which people and critical assets are situated
          in harm’s way; and the potential for socioeconomic disruptions in
          those areas where hazard intensities exceed minimum thresholds of
          damage. The Social Fabric Layer utilizes Census demographic data to
          evaluate broad spatial patterns of vulnerability, and
          neighbourhood-level capacities to withstand and recover from disaster
          events based on intrinsic characteristics of housing, family
          structure, individual autonomy and financial agency. The Risk Dynamics
          Layer utilizes information on population growth and land use change
          since 1975 to evaluate how evolving patterns of urbanization are
          contributing to escalating profiles of natural risk over time across
          Canada. Although developed to support quantitative risk assessments
          and implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction
          at local and regional scales in Canada, the NHSL is also suitable for
          use in other integrated landscape modeling applications, including
          climate change adaptation and sustainable land use planning.

        <h1>National Human Settlement - Natural Hazard Threats</h1>
        <p>
          The Natural Hazard Threat component of the National Human Settlement
          Layer (NHSL) extends capabilities of the physical exposure model to
          address the question of who and what are susceptible to natural
          hazards of concern in Canada. It utilizes available national-level
          information on earthquake, flood, debris flow, wildfire, and severe
          wind hazards to evaluate the extent to which people and critical
          assets are situated in harm’s way (hazard exposure); and the potential
          for socioeconomic disruptions in those areas where hazard intensities
          are likely to exceed minimum thresholds of damage potential (hazard
          susceptibility). Earthquake hazard threats are assessed using
          1/2500-year ground shaking intensity levels developed by the
          Geological Survey of Canada to evaluate minimum thresholds of building
          damage. Wildfire hazard threats are assessed using mean head fire
          intensity (HFI) levels developed by the Canadian Forest Service to
          evaluate community assets at risk. Debris Flow threats are based on a
          multi-variate landslide susceptibility model developed by NASA as part
          of a global early warning system for weather-triggered events.
          Tsunami, riverine flood and severe wind hazard threats are based on
          1/500-year inundation and cyclone models developed as part of the 2011
          Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction (GAR) to inform
          disaster management efforts at regional and national scales.
          Susceptibility to individual hazards is estimated based on the numbers
          of people and critical assets exposed at the Census Dissemination Area
          level. The results are aggregated into a multi-hazard threat index to
          help identify hotspots of concern across Canada.
        </p>

        <h1>National Human Settlement - Physical Exposure</h1>
        <p>
          The Physical Exposure component of the National Human Settlement Layer
          (NHSL) includes a delineation of built-up areas and related functional
          land use classes for Census Dissemination Areas in urban centres and
          rural/remote communities across Canada. It provides detailed
          information on construction type, occupancy and design level for more
          than 9.1 million buildings; population dynamics at different times of
          day for 35.1 million people, and; capital asset valuation of buildings
          and contents totalling more than 8.3 trillion CAD$. The building
          portfolio is classified using a combination of 36 construction
          taxonomies that include different types of wood, concrete, masonry,
          steel and prefabricated structures; and 33 occupancy classes that
          include a mix of residential, civic, commercial and industrial
          functional uses. Context-specific mapping schemes for each combination
          of land use, construction type and occupancy class are used to
          allocate a distribution of building classes that reflect the overall
          structural form and function of a given neighbourhood. Building
          populations at different times of day are estimated for standard
          workday hours when people are in offices, schools or other group
          facilities (9am-5pm); for morning and evening commute hours when
          people are in transit (7am-9am; 5pm-7pm), and; for evening hours when
          the majority of people are at home (7pm-7am). Capital asset valuation
          is based on industry replacement costs of building archetypes for
          representative regions across Canada. The building inventory is
          aligned with international standards for multi-hazard risk assessment
          and is suitable for use in other land use assessment applications that
          may require specific information on the form and/or function of the
          built environment.

        <h1>National Human Settlement - Risk Dynamics</h1>
        <p>
          The Risk Dynamics component of the National Human Settlement Layer
          (NHSL) builds on remote sensing analysis and spatial modeling carried
          out by the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) as part of
          a global study of evolving human settlement patterns and their
          influence on disaster risk and sustainable development (GHSL).
          High-resolution population grids (250m) and land use classification
          models at decadal intervals (1975, 1990, 2000 and 2015) provide a
          framework for evaluating the extent to which human settlements are
          changing in terms of both density and spatial patterns of
          urbanization. These framework datasets are combined with available
          national assessments of earthquake, tsunami, flood, debris flow,
          wildfire and cyclone hazards to help make evident how population
          growth and evolving patterns of land use change over the past 40 years
          are contributing to escalating profiles of natural hazard risk in
          Canada. Indicators of physical exposure and hazard susceptibility are
          reported using the 250m GHSL population grid mesh for each time
          epochs. Outputs of this study complement a global assessment of
          exposure to natural hazards carried out by the JRC as part of the 2017
          Atlas of the Human Planet and provide additional insights to inform
          local and regional disaster resilience planning efforts across Canada.

          National Human Settlement - Social Fabric and Capacity Thresholds
        </h1>
        <p>
          The Social Fabric component of the National Human Settlement Layer
          (NHSL) utilizes available Census demographic data to evaluate broad
          spatial patterns of vulnerability, and neighbourhood-level capacities
          to withstand and recover from disaster events based on characteristics
          of housing, family structure, individual autonomy and financial
          agency. Vulnerability and capacity threshold indicators help to
          identify underlying patterns of social inequity that may exist within
          a given community or region, and to address the question of who is
          likely to bear the greatest burden of risk following a disaster event.
          Levels of vulnerability for each component of the social vulnerability
          index are assessed using analytic methods adapted from the Cutter
          'Hazards of Place Model' to screen and rank demographic variables
          based on their capacity to explain spatial patterns across a broad
          range of community archetypes including dense urban centres,
          surrounding suburban/exurban regions, and more distant rural and
          remote settlements. Composite indicators describing characteristics of
          housing conditions, family structure, individual autonomy and
          financial agency provide a means of comparing relative levels of
          vulnerability from one region to another across Canada and help
          identify specific neighbourhoods within which capacities to withstand
          and recover from disaster events may be strained. Indicators are
          reported at the Census Dissemination Area level and can be used in
          conjunction with information on specific hazard threats to identify
          both potential hotspots of concern within a community or region, and
          areas in which proactive investments in planning and capacity
          development may be effective in building disaster resilience and
          longer-term sustainability.
