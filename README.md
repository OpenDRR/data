Configure Gatsby pages

Breaking down the code:

**`gatsby-node.js`**:

```
const fs = require("fs")
const yaml = require("js-yaml")


exports.createPages = async ({ actions, graphql, reporter }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions
  const details = yaml.load(fs.readFileSync("./content/data/yaml/details.yaml", "utf-8"))
  details.forEach(element => {
    createPage({
      path: element.path,
      component: require.resolve("./src/templates/datasetDetails.js"),
      context: {
        details: element.details
      },
    })
  })

```


1. import file sync(fs) & js-yaml
2. Load the 'details.yaml' and parse the content
3. Using Gatsby's createPage() [API]('https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#createPage'),
 we create pages programmatically from the parsed file.


4. Using the context property we pass our data into the page as a special prop named 'details', allowing it to be consumed. Read more on contexts [here]('https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/creating-and-modifying-pages/') 

Create a template 
To finish the page generation process of the sourced content, we must create a template for producing dynamic pages from data

**`src/templates/datasetDetails.js`**
```
import React from "react"
import { Link } from "gatsby"
const basicTemplate = props => {
  const { pageContext } = props
  const { pageContent, links } = pageContext

  return (
    <div style={{ maxWidth: `960px`, margin: `1.45rem` }}>
      <ul>
        {pageContent.map((data, index) => {
          return <li key={`content_item_${index}`}>{data.item}</li>
        })}
      </ul>
      <ul>
        {links.map((item, index) => {
          return (
            <li key={`link_${index}`}>
              <Link to={item.to}>{item.to}</Link>
            </li>
          )
        })}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
export default basicTemplate
```

Running gatsby develop in the terminal and opening a browser window to http://localhost:8000/page1 you’ll see a page with content that was sourced from a YAML file used to generate your site.







## 🚀 Quick start
1. ** Clone the repo **
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/OpenDRR/data.git
    cd data
    yarn install // npm install
    gatsby develop
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `opendrr-geospatial` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
